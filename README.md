ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Samalander0.You may know me as Samalander, Sam Cheng, or Just Sam ðŸ™‚

I'm an aspiring web developer and UI designer, and I've been learning how to make website experiences for the past few years. I live in Silicon Valley, and have a super cute dog named Bailey. If you'd like to contact me or learn more about me, you can check out [my website](https://www.samalander.dev).  

I'm currently working on [Beedol](https://github.com/samalander0/Beedol), a fourm for posting how to articles, and I'm also working on remaking my personal website.

Thanks for learning about me! I'm glad you're interested. If you'd like to talk about working with me, or just ask a question, you can contact me on [my website](https://www.samalander.dev), or DM me on Discord if that works for you (I'm Samalander#0001).
